# Dynamic Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio site. Users use the draggable tiles to select skills important for their teams, and the portfolio displays a list of projects relevant to those skills.

This project demonstrates Ember helpers, services, and computed properties.

It also demonstrates using `event.dataTransfer` to move data between Ember components on drag actions.
